"Character is made of duty and love and sympathy, and, above all, of living and working for others.",Sympathy
"I have every sympathy for writers. It's a mystery to me what they do. I can edit. I can cross out and say, 'I'm not saying that' or, 'How about we move this to here? Wouldn't that make that bit of the story better?' But where any of it comes from is beyond me. I will never write a play or a novel.",Sympathy
My impressions of the Russian Revolution can be divided into two periods. The first period was when I showed deep sympathy. My second period is one of disappointment. This change was the result of close observation on the spot.,Sympathy
"Sympathy constitutes friendship; but in love there is a sort of antipathy, or opposing passion. Each strives to be the other, and both together make up one whole.",Sympathy
All sympathy not consistent with acknowledged virtue is but disguised selfishness.,Sympathy

"There is something terribly morbid in the modern sympathy with pain. One should sympathise with the colour, the beauty, the joy of life. The less said about life's sores the better.",Sympathy
September 11th was a moment when America had the sympathy of the world.,Sympathy
Tribes don't need Congressmembers' sympathy. What tribes need is for us to properly exercise our duty.,Sympathy

"Moreover, Hispanics' sympathy for big government represents a cultural predilection as well as an economic one.",Sympathy
I feel sympathy for the working class lad. I've always championed about ticket prices and try to equate that to people's salaries.,Sympathy
"I have several close friends who are insomniacs. Over the years, I've heard their stories about being up in the middle of the night, completely awake. I see them yawn at 11 A.M. and know that, regardless of what they are doing, they'd probably rather be in bed sleeping. I've always had sympathy for them, but I've never really understood it.",Sympathy

"If you want to devote yourself to the arts, you'd better do it strictly from passion, because there is zero guarantee that you'll get anywhere.

"When our bodies are sick and people extend their sympathy, bring us soup, offer up solutions. When our minds are sick, people tend to shy away from you, be afraid, or call you outright crazy.

"When you're successful, people have no sympathy. Nobody wants to catch the tears of a millionaire.",Sympathy
You develop a sympathy for all human beings when you travel a lot.,Sympathy

But in reality they are far more likely to feel isolated, fearful, and ashamed, overwhelmed by grief and guilt, angry at the criminal-justice system, and shunned by their old friends.",Sympathy
I have to have a character worth caring about. I tend not to start writing books about people I don't have a lot of sympathy for because I'm just going to be with them too long.,Sympathy
"You can't have empathy for somebody that's gone through something you haven't - because, definitionally, you can't. But you can feel for them and have sympathy for them. And that's what this country needs to practice more. It's about realizing that you do come from a different place.",Sympathy

I wasn't a person to cry or point fingers or find any sympathy.,Sympathy
"Sympathy relies on a common experience. If you're clumsy, you might have sympathy for others who tend to bump into things. Empathy, on the other hand, is the ability to understand another person's feelings even if you've never experienced them yourself.",Sympathy
"I have sympathy for the people in Syria, and I do think there should be a worldwide response, but we should act cautiously.",Sympathy
"What is the meaning of 'gossip?' Doesn't it originate with sympathy, an interest in one's neighbor, degenerating into idle curiosity and love of tattling?

Both people deserve it.",Sympathy
"I have a great deal of sympathy for reluctant readers because I was one. I would do anything to avoid reading. In my case, it wasn't until I was 13 and discovered the 'Lord of the Rings' that I learned to love reading.",Sympathy
"Jewish Americans weren't just integrated, like other ethnic and religious groups. They also attracted a particular sympathy and admiration, rooted in Holocaust remembrance, affection for Israel, and a distinctive pride in the scope of their success.",Sympathy
"As far as I'm concerned, I own my dogs as I own my body. My legs are with me when I take a shower, and I feel no shame.
